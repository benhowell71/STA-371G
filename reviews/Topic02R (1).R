# some possible problems when importing data
# this is very important! if you run into an issue importing data on an exam
# you will not be given extra time.  
# one of these methods will be able to fix the problem!

# the first row of the csv file is interpreted as values rather that column names!
# and the column names are V1, V2, ...
# how would you fix this?
# two possibilities
data = read.csv(...,header=TRUE)
# when you do file -> import data set -> from text (base) be sure to click the button that says yes for heading
# otherwise you can assign the column names to be the first row and then remove first row
colnames(data) = data[1,]
nrows = nrow(data)
data = data[2:nrows,]

# other possible problem: the name of the first column has some weird Ã¯ at the beginning?!?!
# you can just change the name of that first column
colnames(data)[1] = 'new_name_NO_SPACES'
# then you can reference it using the new name!
